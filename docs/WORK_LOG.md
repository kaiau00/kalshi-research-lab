# Work log

## 2026-09-14 — scope and foundation

- User approved BTC-only, $10/month Railway target, private `kaiau00/kalshi-research-lab`.
- Created fresh Desktop repository. No old bot source, credentials, or data imported.
- Verified a public current KXBTC15M market: `floor_strike`, `greater_or_equal`, explicit BRTI-average rules, and subcent price ranges are present. Use metadata, not ticker parsing or a cached spot opening value.
- Documented checkpoint plan and acceptance tests before implementation.

## Implementation and validation

2026-09-14: Implemented the recorder, hash-chained compressed SQLite store with a single-writer lock, book normalization, benchmark-average forecast, three independent simulated accounts, delayed IOC execution, reports, historical screening, protected dashboard and deployment files.

Validation: 27 regression tests pass. They cover limit enforcement, partial fills, cash/fee reconciliation, official settlement, stale/gapped inputs, book complements, duplicate index observations, accumulated settlement averages, unknown fees and fee changes during order latency, raw integrity/tamper detection, WAL backup/restore, deterministic replay, sealed holdout, forward registration, dashboard guards and RSA signing. Test-client dependencies emit two deprecation warnings; tests pass.

Public integration: 12 real BTC markets downloaded with candle data and zero download errors. The historical screen reports 5 unavailable/invalid quote samples rather than fabricating prices. This is an integration sample, not evidence for or against a trading edge.

Running-service smoke check: public metadata discovery succeeds; password is required; health is 200; data readiness without a Kalshi key is 503. A process restart preserves the event hash chain and a single experiment registration. Evidence is in `docs/validation/local-smoke.json`. No Kalshi credentials were read or installed.

Container validation: GitHub Actions successfully built the Docker image and started it with external networking disabled. The image includes the dashboard, requires authentication, passes process health, and correctly fails data readiness without a feed. [Container validation run](https://github.com/kaiau00/kalshi-research-lab/actions/runs/34920769606). Hosted commissioning remains unverified.

Hosting blocked: Railway rejected creation of the fresh project with “Usage limit exceeded. Please increase or remove the hard limit to resume resource provisioning.” No workspace spending setting or old service was changed. The user has been asked whether to leave hosting pending or resolve the limit themselves.

Remaining gates: clear the Railway provisioning block; deploy the new dedicated service and volume; add the user's Kalshi key through secret variables; audit real authenticated book/BRTI streams, account fee rounding, resource consumption and restart/recovery. These gates must pass before calling collection commissioned. No live trading code exists.


## 2026-09-17 — hosted service and cost cleanup

After the user activated Hobby, deployed the dedicated research service and persistent volume. Corrected the public domain target port through the dedicated domain API after an environment patch did not persist. Observed deployment SUCCESS and verified external health, authentication, public metadata discovery, and controlled restart with unchanged experiment registration and retained events. Kalshi credentials remain absent; authenticated feed auditing remains open.

The user requested no other running/costing projects and explicitly approved deleting five old volumes. Removed old active deployments, disconnected sources that could auto-deploy, and verified all nine old projects have no active deployments, scheduled runs, or deployment triggers. The old volumes are detached and scheduled for permanent deletion on September 18. Preserved the existing $10 workspace hard usage limit. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for the hosted URL, access instructions, evidence and remaining commissioning gates.


## 2026-09-17 — authorized Kalshi credential migration

At the user's explicit request, retrieved the existing Kalshi key pair from old Railway variables. Verified it through a read-only authenticated BRTI subscription, then copied only the key ID and base64 private key directly into the new Railway service. Secret values were neither displayed nor saved locally. The earlier blanket no-credential-reuse repository rule now records this explicit user authorization.

Redeployment reached SUCCESS. Hosted collector reports recording; readiness is 200 with fresh valid order-book and BRTI observations. Initial data had no malformed frames or clock adjustments, and one expected new-session marker. Authenticated data collection is active; full-market execution/settlement auditing and high-throughput capacity work remain open.


Live rollover revealed snapshots with omitted empty depth arrays. Corrected normalization and two-sided readiness, preserving rejection of malformed present arrays. Added seven regression cases; 34 tests pass and Ruff is clean. Deploy the corrected source with a new experiment directory `/data/normalizer-v2` on the existing volume, preserving the initial raw dataset and its registration.
